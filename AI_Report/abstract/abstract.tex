\begin{abstract}
For the voluntary term project for the AI Course, we have decided to focus on implementations of concepts that we have learned throughout the entire course. An excellent platform for this was fount to be the Pac-Man Projects \cite{PacMan2015} created by Dan Klein and John DeNero. The projects provide a game environment to implement all the basics learned in this course through small, completely contained simulators where modules for path planning, adversarial search games and reinforcement learning modules for Markov Decision Processes and Q-Learning can be implemented without worrying about details for setting up the simulator system which doesn't come into consideration while working on the core AI tasks.
