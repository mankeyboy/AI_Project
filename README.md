###AI Project for the Artificial Intelligence Course at IIT KGP

The base project material for this has been taken directly from the edX.org course on Artificial Intelligence by Prof. Dan Klein & David Hall.

More data, details and prerequisites about each of the sections from [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

Implemented for the course for extra marks for a project submission. 
Lame reason, I know :P 
It still was fun! :D And that was why I took the course anyway :P
