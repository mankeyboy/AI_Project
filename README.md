###AI Project for the Artificial Intelligence Course at IIT KGP

The base project material for this has been taken directly from the edX.org course on Artificial Intelligence by Prof. Dan Klein & David Hall.

More data, details and prerequisites about each of the sections from [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).

Implemented for the course for extra marks for a project submission.  
Lame reason, I know :P 
It still was fun! :D And that was why I took the course anyway :P

The parts that have been completed are the following:

	1. tutorial <useless mostly>
	2. search <A star and ID Astar>
	3. multiagent <minimax, alpha-beta and expectiminimax>
	4. reinforcement <Value Iteration, Q-Learning and Approx Q-Learning>
	5. tracking <Eating ghosts now!>

Incomplete: 

	1. classification <digit classification, perceptron and pacman behaviourial cloning>
	2. contest

Ignore:

	Assignment_2
	It has a basic 8 puzzle solver given the set of initial positions using AStar and IDAstar.

I will try to complete the classification tasks sometime later if I find the time. Until then, this is the final state of things :)
